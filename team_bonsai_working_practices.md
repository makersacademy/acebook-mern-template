We are team Bonsai

Bearing in mind the EQ learning weâ€™ve done with Dana and elsewhere, we want to foster a good team to work in

We plan to meet
At 10:00am for morning standup
We break at 13:00 - 14:00 for lunch
At 2pm for afternoon checkin
At 5pm for a 10min retro at the end of the day

We value:
Honesty
Compassion (Support/Empathy)
Learning
Efficiency (Structure)
(in that order)
Sharing positive feedback
Pairing with different people every day
Not spending longer than 30 minutes on once specific problem. Park it until you can get help.


We will have a nominated leader/spokesperson which will rotate every other day

9th + 10th - Nicola
11th + 12th - Eliza
13th + 16th - Aziz
17th + 18th - Eva
19th - Henry
20th - Bakhta

When we are upset we will raise it immediately in the Slack channel, separating the facts and the story as far as we are able, and giving actionable, specific and kind feedback as appropriate
