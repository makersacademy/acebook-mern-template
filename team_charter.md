### Values

- Putting in Trello
- Core Values
    - Communicating

    - Not about getting the job done
    - learning to communicate
- Individual values
    - Ryan - CSS

### Software building practices

- Versioning practices
- Using .then instead of async await.


### Feedback process - individual concerns

1. Speak to the person individually and not in the group
2. Communicate it, take some time away if you are getting frustrated
3. Reflect on yourself before discussing.

EECK - Feedback about behaviour rather than character

### Considerations in a Retro

- What has gone well?

- What hasn’t gone so well?

- Was everyone’s voice heard in the team? If not, how can we make it better?

- Is everyone up to speed with where we are at? Did we all understand the steps to get here? If not, how can we make it
  better?

- Does everyone feel happy working in the team? If not, how can we make it better?

- Are we having fun in the team? If not, how can we make it better?

- Did we take regular breaks? If not, how can we make it better?

- What are the next things we want to work on and who wants to work on what?

- By when should these things be coded? What is the most likely reason for this plan not to work and how could we
  preempt that?

- Have we been helping each other effectively? How can we improve our collaboration?

- How are we following the XP values? Which are blind spots in our team (e.g. the quality of communication)?

- Are we using/experiencing agile development? / What are the links to Agile development in what we’ve been doing?

- If you could change one thing about your experience working as a team so far, what would it be?

- When did we feel most productive and happy so far? How can we use this to impact the rest of our time working as a
  team?

- What techniques have we found useful so far?

- What has been the most challenging part of the project so far and how did we deal with this as a team? How could we
  have improved our approach to this challenge?

Communication is a main thing, whether you are working in a team.
